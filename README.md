## üîß Customization (Make Your Own Quiz!)

This project was not designed to be easily customized. But you can create your own quiz by editing just one file: `js/questions.js`. <b>***After you've cloned it that is***</b>

**How to Add or Change Questions:**

1.  Open the `js/questions.js` file.
2.  You will see an array named `questions`. Each object in this array is a new question.
3.  To add a new question, add a new object to the array with the following structure:

    ```javascript
    // Example of the question object structure
    {
      numb: 6, // The new question number
      question: "What does SQL stand for?",
      answer: "Structured Query Language", // The correct answer
      options: [
        "Stylish Question Language",
        "Stylesheet Query Language",
        "Statement Question Language",
        "Structured Query Language" // All options, including the correct one
      ]
    }
    ```
4.  Save the file, and your new question will automatically appear in the quiz!
